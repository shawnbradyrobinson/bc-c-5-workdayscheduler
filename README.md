# Bootcamp Challenge 5 - Work Day Scheduler 

# Shawn Robinson 



## **Description**
The "Work Day Scheduler" application is an awesome way for productive individuals to keep track of their tasks and responsibilities for the day!

The application has a colorful and vibrant interface, that visually communicates to the user where they should orient their focus. 

The "Work Day Scheduler" app keeps track of current time in the day up to the very second, and will color code the hours of the day based on this information. Find the red box to get started adding in things for the rest of the day, or navigate to the 7AM box at the top to get a head start on scheduling for tomorrow!

Once you have entered information in a time slot, simply press the corresonding "save" icon, and your to-do's will stay put, even upon refresh! One less thing you need to worry about as you work your way through the day!

An element that makes this application stand out beyond other applications is the fact that the user is given visual feedback whenever they hit a save button on the tracker, allowing the user to have the peace of mind the application has properly processed their request!
